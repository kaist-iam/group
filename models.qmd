-   [GCAM-core](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core) : The Joint Global Change Research Institute (JGCRI) is the home and primary development institution for GCAM, an integrated assessment tool for exploring consequences and responses to global change. GCAM has been developed at PNNL for over 20 years and is now a freely available community model and documented online.

-   GCAM-KAIST\[in preparation\] : KAIST IAM Group's efforts involve customizing GCAM7 to make it a more accurate and relevant tool for assessing and understanding the implications of global change within the specific context of Korea.
