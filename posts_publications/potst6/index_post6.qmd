*A new study published in Environmental Science and Technology has made a significant contribution to understanding and addressing carbon emissions in the chemical industry.*

This research improves upon the integrated assessment model, GCAM, by including processes such as steam cracking, which is prevalent in the organic chemical industry. The study evaluates various carbon reduction strategies like catalytic cracking, low-carbon process heat, and feedstock switching.

Key findings of the study indicate that while emerging catalytic production technologies might not substantially reduce mid-century emissions, generating process heat can lead to considerable mitigation, potentially cutting CO2 emissions by about 76% by 2050. This is achievable through methods like carbon capture and storage (CCS), hydrogen, and electrification. The research also points out that a significant amount of energy in this sector is used for producing chemicals like ammonia and methanol, necessitating detailed modeling to assess these carbon reduction pathways effectively.

A notable feature of this model is its detailed parameterization of both traditional and alternative organic chemical manufacturing processes, including waste management for end-of-life products like plastics. The study also examines interactions with other economic sectors and the global economy, underscoring the potential of electrification and clean hydrogen. Additionally, it highlights that future net CO2 emissions are highly sensitive to the global deployment of CCS. Achieving net-zero emissions seems unattainable if the rate of waste incineration increases without coupling it with CCS. Furthermore, reducing feedstock emissions depends significantly on using biogenic carbon as an alternative feedstock and effective waste treatment of plastics.

This research represents a substantial step forward in mitigating the impact of the organic chemical sector on climate change. It suggests a more integrated approach to explore various carbon mitigation strategies and calls for further research in different industries for more significant carbon reduction in the future.

"Petrochemicals industry is inherently fossil fuel driven," said KAIST Visiting Professor Haewon McJeon, who coauthored the paper. "Decarbonizing chemical production emissions will be difficult but crucial contribution to achieving net-zero emissions."
