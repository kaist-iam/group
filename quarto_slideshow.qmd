## 4. Making your own git branch
:::{.callout-note}
if anything on github is confusing, just ask chatGPT!
:::
1. Go to [GCAM-KAIST](https://github.com/GCAM-KAIST/gcam-core).

2. Pick a branch to start from (currently: hcm/proj/kaist7update).

3. Create your own branch [you own this. No one else will make changes to your own branch].

4. [git clone](https://github.com/GCAM-KAIST/gcam-core.git) [this creates a full repo of GCAM-KAIST].

5. git checkout [your branch name] [this sets your branch on your own computer].

6. Try making a small inconsequential change. Such as adding a small xml file in the input/policy folder.

7. git add [file you added].

8. git commit [this will commit all files you added/changed]. 

9. git push.

10. Confirm that your commit has been correctly pushed to github.

11.  (if you are happy with your development, and would like it to be applied to ALL GCAM-KAIST users) create a pull request (PR) [back into the main GCAM-KAIST repo].

12. Assign me (d3y419) as the reviewer. I’ll review the PR and merge as needed.

# Transition to GCAM-KAIST 7.0: Instructions and Next Steps

As we embark on an exciting and crucial phase of updating our energy assessment model from GCAM-KAIST 2.0 to GCAM-KAIST 7.0, the following instructions and guidelines will ensure a smooth transition. Each one of the team is responsible for a particular XML file which is identified in the following [link](gcam-kaist-upgrade7b.xlsx).


## 1. Download the Required Versions
GCAM 7.0 Official Release by JCRI: You can download this latest version from the following [link](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/releases/download/gcam-v7.0/gcam-v7.0-Windows-Release-Package.zip).


GCAM-KAIST 2.0: This is our specialized version at KAIST. Please download it using the [link](https://o365kaist-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ahmeds_office_kaist_ac_kr/EuCnuJZbojFLjz5o0q3dwaYBQ4QihxB_7z8umGiHIeos8A?e=jnZFqE) .

## 2. Analyze the Differences
XML File Comparison: Please compare the XML files between the two versions as per your specific task in the google sheet.
Document the Differences: Note any discrepancies, changes, or new features. This will help us understand what needs to be transferred or adapted.

## 3. Update GCAM 7.0 with GCAM-KAIST 2.0 Data
Modify the Original GCAM 7.0 XML Files: Replace the necessary data with the corresponding data from GCAM-KAIST 2.0.
Follow the Evolution Process: This is vital to complete the transformation from GCAM-KAIST 2.0 to GCAM-KAIST 7.0 by checking the "comparison with GCAM-KAIST2" column in google sheet. After running the scenario, you can check if the results are different from GCAM-KAIST2.0 or not.

## 4. Prepare for Tomorrow's Meeting
Clarification of Differences: Be prepared to discuss the differences you've identified and how you've addressed them.
