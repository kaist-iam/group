Decision-makers working on strategies to achieve the US net-zero emission goal need to have a broader understanding of the economic and sustainability impacts. In a new paper published in Energy and Climate Change journal, international team of researchers from X, Y, and Z used an integrated assessment model to investigate four approaches to achieving the U.S. net-zero emission goal and analyzed their impacts on energy, water, land, and public health within each state. \"This research serves as a foundation for gaining a deeper understanding of the effects of the U.S. net-zero emission goal and aims to lead this goal towards cost-effective and environmentally sustainable change,\" said Haewon McJeon, visiting professor at KAIST Graduate School of Green Growth & Sustainability.

This study utilizes GCAM v6.0 USA version, focusing on modeling various elements of the U.S., including its economy, energy system, agriculture, land use, water, and more, at the state level. The model incorporates consistent assumptions regarding population and economic growth and includes estimates for past and future greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutant levels. The research presents four distinct pathways to achieve net-zero emissions in the U.S. These pathways include the existing net-zero pathway, along with three additional alternative net-zero pathways designed to account for uncertainties in low-carbon technologies, carbon removal methods, and carbon reduction. GCAM-USA takes into account price adjustment for non-CO2 greenhouse gases, as well as considers the impact of technology lifespan tracking and mortality rates related to particulate matter exposure. 

The findings of this study suggest that the net-zero emissions pathway requires a significant reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. The electricity and transportation sectors play a pivotal role, and achieving this goal necessitates a combination of fundamental GHG emissions reductions and the implementation of carbon dioxide removal technologies (CDR). The successful execution of carbon removal technologies depends on technology, economic viability, public approval, and regulatory support. Regionally within the United States, several states play a critical role in GHG emissions reduction, with states such as Texas, California, and Florida being among the significant contributors. These states account for a substantial portion of the national GHG reduction, with much of the emphasis on GHG reductions primarily within the electricity sector. Carbon removal technologies are distributed differently among states, with Texas, for instance, having a larger carbon capture capacity due to factors like its geological terrain. Nevertheless, substantial investments and policy support are required to achieve large-scale carbon capture. Clean energy investments also hold a vital role in accomplishing carbon reductions, with expanding renewable energy capacity and reducing fossil fuel capacity being crucial focal points. Additionally, the U.S. net-zero pathway offers environmental benefits, including positive impacts on demand reduction, air quality, and land use. Sustainability outcomes in the net-zero pathway can vary depending on the specific trajectory, with diverse co-benefits and trade-offs observed on a state-by-state basis. 

This study provides a comprehensive analysis to evaluate the US net-zero emission goals and to understand state-level actions and interactions. It considers various net-zero pathways while accounting for uncertainties such as low-carbon technologies, carbon management strategies, policies, behavioral changes, and more. The research results illustrate that these different pathways may have varying economic and sustainability impacts in each state, emphasizing the importance of considering this diversity of impacts. It also highlights that not accounting for these various effects can be problematic. Furthermore, in addition to the climate mitigation benefits, the study identifies environmental benefits, such as water conservation and air quality improvements. However, it acknowledges that in some states, there may be discrepancies between mitigation costs and benefits, which can vary depending on the burden-sharing approach. The study also explores burden-sharing approaches, demonstrating varying outcomes on a state-by-state basis and underscoring the importance of state and federal cooperation for the United States to achieve its net-zero goals. The research also highlights the need for capital investments in the net-zero transition and underscores the critical role of policies and regulations.  

Korea also has a 2050 carbon neutrality goal. The lessons learned from this research can also be expanded to better understanding the economically sustainable transition towards achieving net-zero emissions in Korea. An in-depth research is needed for the comprehensive assessment of Korea\'s net-zero transitions.
