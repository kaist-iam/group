Regional population and labor productivity growth assumptions drive the energy and land-use systems employing numerous technology options to produce, transform, and provide energy services as well as to produce agriculture and forest products, and to determine land use and land cover. Using a run period extending from 1990 – 2100 at 5 year intervals, GCAM has been used to explore the potential role of emerging energy supply technologies and the greenhouse gas consequences of specific policy measures or energy technology adoption including; CO2 capture and storage, bioenergy, hydrogen systems, nuclear energy, renewable energy technology, and energy use technology in buildings, industry and the transportation sectors. GCAM is an Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)-class model. This means it can be used to simulate scenarios, policies, and emission targets from various sources including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Output includes projections of future energy supply and demand and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions, radiative forcing and climate effects of 16 greenhouse gases, aerosols and short-lived species at 0.5×0.5 degree resolution, contingent on assumptions about future population, economy, technology, and climate mitigation policy."

    "title": "How to Slow Global Warming: Three Widescale Efforts Could Make the Difference",
    "section": "",
    "text": "RICHLAND, Wash.—With the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference just 10 weeks  away, countries will soon take stock of their progress in the worldwide effort to slow and adapt to global warming. Better known as COP28, the conference offers the chance for countries to meet and coordinate their climate-mitigating pledges, like achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 or peak emissions by 2030. \nPast research suggests that, if current pledges are upheld, the world is roughly enroute to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius. But the original goal of the Paris Agreement – the 2015 climate change treaty in which 196 countries aspired to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees by the end of this century – remains stubbornly out of reach. \n“There’s the bad news,” said Haewon McJeon, visiting professor at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology, whose research often focuses on assessing climate pledges. “We took stock of the current climate pledges around the world, and it all falls far short of the 1.5-degree goal. It’s not enough.”\nWhat can countries do to bring the goal back within reach? In new commentary published in the journal One Earth, researchers highlight that the biggest climate mitigation gains stand to be realized through three global efforts: reigning in non-CO2 emissions like methane and fluorinated gasses, ramping up carbon dioxide removal, and halting deforestation. Make sufficient progress in these areas, the authors said, and the 1.5-degree goal may inch back within our crosshairs.\n“Mitigating emissions from all sources will be critical to limiting warming to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius,” said Earth scientist Gokul Iyer, lead author on the commentary. “While most efforts to date have focused on carbon dioxide emissions in the energy sector, those three areas present opportunities for further ratcheting of ambition.”\nAn opportunity to adjust course is fast-approaching. The Paris Agreement holds a built-in “ratcheting” mechanism; a course-correcting process where countries can regularly revise their climate pledges in five-year increments. Its purpose is to bring about more bold and ambitious action within the push to curb warming. COP28 marks the first time participating countries will undergo this “progress review,” known as the Global Stocktake. \nRatchet up ambition to dial down emissions: Beyond carbon dioxide\nCarbon dioxide is the most well-known greenhouse gas, yet it is one of several. Though less prevalent, other gasses like methane and nitrous oxide can trap even more heat. The latter can linger in Earth’s troposphere for well over a century, before ultimately moving to the stratosphere, where it chips away at the ozone layer.\nDialing down non-CO2 emissions sooner rather than later, the authors said, could help curb peak warming this century.\n“Doing so could”flatten the curve” of a temperature overshoot, where global temperatures exceed 1.5 degrees and eventually cool back down”, said Yang Ou, a co-author on the study and researcher at the College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering at Peking University.\nSome progress here has already been made, notably the Global Methane Pledge, in which over 150 countries voluntarily pledged to reduce methane emissions. Yet more detailed actions are needed, the authors said. \nFortunately, many of the technologies needed to reduce non-CO2 emissions already exist. Substituting climate-friendly cooling agents, detecting and repairing natural gas leaks, and recovering refrigerants when disposing of air conditioning or refrigeration equipment all could help in diminishing those emissions. Widespread dietary changes, like eating less meat, could also help dial down emissions within the agricultural sector. \nStill, the authors said, more progress is needed. Countries could address a wider range of non-CO2 emissions. Currently, methane takes a large focus, whereas nitrous oxide and fluorinated gasses are equally if not more important, according to the new work.\nAnd as new mitigation measures around these long-unaddressed emissions come into existence, countries could benefit from considering all sectors and sources from which they flow, from livestock to energy production.\nRamping up carbon dioxide removal\nRemoving carbon dioxide from Earth’s atmosphere is essential, the authors said. They highlight an important gap between the amount of carbon dioxide countries have pledged to remove versus the amount that must be removed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.\nCurrent pledges are insufficient; we must pull an additional 1-3 gigatons of carbon dioxide from Earth’s atmosphere annually by 2030, and 2-7 gigatons annually by 2050. Otherwise, the 1.5-degree goal will likely remain out of reach.\nMany carbon dioxide removal technologies remain nascent and expensive. Yet, to meet the warming goal, they must be made cost-effective and deployed at wide scales. The next decade, the authors said, is key.\nThe authors call for incentives to drum up research, development, demonstration, and the deployment of novel and alternative carbon dioxide removal methods. A wide-ranging approach to carbon removal offers the surest course, from afforestation and reforestation to the use of biofuels paired with carbon capture and storage.\nThe authors note some progress: investments in carbon dioxide removal technology have swelled in recent years, totaling $4 billion in publicly funded research. Yet only a few countries have made such investments, which have mostly focused on a limited number of removal methods. \n“More widespread participation could ultimately drive down costs”, said McJeon, a coauthor of the new commentary. “And it could demonstrate an important point: that carbon dioxide removal can be carried out around the world in a variety of ways, as each region is better suited for some removal methods over others”. \nHalting deforestation\nThe authors of the new commentary point to 4.1 million hectares of tropical forest lost to deforestation in 2022 alone. A significant chunk of global emissions – 16 percent – flowed from deforestation and other forms of land use change between 2012 and 2021. In some regions, forests that were once carbon sinks have turned into sources. What could greater ambition in this area look like?\nThe authors suggest several courses of action. Putting caps on climbing deforestation rates could help. Ceasing or reducing consumption of products like palm oil or soy, too, could protect forests in important regions like South America. \nBetter monitoring of illegal mining and hunting, creating new incentives to protect fire-prone forests from severe wildfire, and financing commitments to protect forests are all examples of worthwhile efforts, the authors said. \nThe team pays kudos to the European Union, the United Kingdom and Brazil, whose governments recently reported significant declines in deforestation rates since July 2022. The Forests and Climate Leaders’ Partnership – a joint declaration to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030 – was signed by over 100 countries at COP27. If we are to meet the warming goal, however, similar progress must be made at a wider scale.\n“While the upcoming global stocktake process will likely focus on assessing climate actions and progress made to date,” said Iyer, “it will be important to focus negotiations and discussions on initiatives to ratchet ambition in hitherto ignored areas. Progress in those areas could greatly shape the trajectory of global emissions in the coming decades and improve our chances of staying below 1.5 degrees Celsius.”\nThis work stems from the Joint Global Change Research Institute, a partnership between the University of Maryland and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. There, researchers from a wide range of disciplines collaborate to model human and Earth systems, from those that harness and deliver energy into our homes to the ones that govern extreme weather. Their findings help policymakers to make informed decisions about the wide range of potential consequences that flow from societal action.\nIn addition to Iyer, Jae Edmonds is also a PNNL author of this work. Alongside McJeon and Ou, their coauthors include Ryna Cui and Nathan Hultman of the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland, and Allen Fawcett of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\nLink"

    "title": "Global Stocktake: to limit global warming to 1.5°C, continued ratcheting of decarbonization is needed",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In a new commentary in One Earth, the international group of researchers from Korea, China, and the U.S. take stock of the current NDCs and assess the need to increase near-term decarbonization ambition to limit global warming to 1.5°C.\nKAIST Graduate School of Green Growth & Sustainability visiting professor Haewon McJeon stated that “while the NDCs submitted at COP26 in November 2021 collectively steered us toward limiting global temperature rise to under 2°C by the century’s end but fell short of the ambitious 1.5°C goal.”\nCOP28’s central focus is on the Global Stocktake (GST), designed to assess countries’ progress toward their NDCs and the Agreement’s long-term objectives. While evaluating progress remains key, the GST also aims to pinpoint priority areas for enhanced ambition to align with the Paris Agreement’s long-term goal of keeping global temperature increase below 1.5°C. Three critical policy areas stand out: non-CO2 gases, carbon dioxide removal (CDR), and deforestation. Decision-makers are urged to concentrate their efforts in these areas during COP28 and the GST to better align countries’ commitments with the Paris Agreement’s long-term climate objectives.\n\n\nThe initial NDCs submitted after the 2015 Paris Agreement fell short of the 2°C target, with a high risk of exceeding 3°C. COP26 showcased the Agreement’s ratcheting mechanism, resulting in updated NDCs and ambitious decarbonization pledges. If countries maintain a 2% decarbonization rate beyond 2030, there’s a >50% chance of limiting end-of-century warming to <2°C, rising to nearly 70% with a 5% rate. However, achieving the aspirational 1.5°C goal remains unlikely, necessitating further ambition. Even with enhanced ambition, global temperatures may temporarily exceed 1.5°C this century, making near-term collective ambition vital to limit temperature overshooting and incentivize R&D in technologies like carbon dioxide removal, accelerate fossil fuel phase-out, and engage the private sector for cost-effective long-term GHG reductions.\nKey gaps persist in climate policy despite progress. Addressing non-CO2 emissions, carbon dioxide removal (CDR), and halting deforestation is crucial. Reducing non-CO2 emissions by 2030 can help curb temperature rise and overshooting the 1.5°C threshold, impacting global temperature change. CDR, essential for achieving net-zero emissions, lacks detailed plans in many countries’ commitments. There’s a gap between proposed CDR levels and what’s needed for Paris goals, and current technologies are not ready or cost-effective. Incentivizing research and development in novel CDR methods is vital. Halting deforestation is paramount, as it contributes significantly to emissions, but despite commitments, deforestation continues, driven by commercial crop expansion. Closing these policy gaps is essential for effective climate action.\nAchieving deeper near-term reductions in non-CO2 emissions is feasible through various technological solutions, including end-of-pipe control measures and behavioral changes like dietary shifts. Some post-COP26 efforts, such as the United States Inflation Reduction Act and China’s policies addressing methane emissions, demonstrate increased ambition in this regard. However, global ambition in non-CO2 emission reductions should encompass a broader range of gases, account for emissions from all sectors, and prioritize R&D for long-term solutions. Additionally, scaling up carbon dioxide removal (CDR) measures is essential, requiring increased investment in a diverse portfolio of CDR technologies beyond current efforts. Effective emissions trading mechanisms for CDR necessitate robust accounting rules and monitoring frameworks, as well as consideration of synergies and tradeoffs with other sustainability priorities.\nImplications for Korea: Korea has set an ambitious goal to achieve carbon neutrality, but to contribute meaningfully to global collective action and achieve the 1.5°C goal, there is a need for strengthening near-term NDCs. Faster coal-fired powerplant retirement and rapid increase in clean power generation will be critical near-term steps."

    "title": "Global Stocktake: to limit global warming to 1.5°C, continued ratcheting of decarbonization is needed",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In a new commentary in One Earth, the international group of researchers from Korea, China, and the U.S. take stock of the current NDCs and assess the need to increase near-term decarbonization ambition to limit global warming to 1.5°C.\nKAIST Graduate School of Green Growth & Sustainability visiting professor Haewon McJeon stated that “while the NDCs submitted at COP26 in November 2021 collectively steered us toward limiting global temperature rise to under 2°C by the century’s end but fell short of the ambitious 1.5°C goal.”\nCOP28’s central focus is on the Global Stocktake (GST), designed to assess countries’ progress toward their NDCs and the Agreement’s long-term objectives. While evaluating progress remains key, the GST also aims to pinpoint priority areas for enhanced ambition to align with the Paris Agreement’s long-term goal of keeping global temperature increase below 1.5°C. Three critical policy areas stand out: non-CO2 gases, carbon dioxide removal (CDR), and deforestation. Decision-makers are urged to concentrate their efforts in these areas during COP28 and the GST to better align countries’ commitments with the Paris Agreement’s long-term climate objectives.\n\n\nThe initial NDCs submitted after the 2015 Paris Agreement fell short of the 2°C target, with a high risk of exceeding 3°C. COP26 showcased the Agreement’s ratcheting mechanism, resulting in updated NDCs and ambitious decarbonization pledges. If countries maintain a 2% decarbonization rate beyond 2030, there’s a >50% chance of limiting end-of-century warming to <2°C, rising to nearly 70% with a 5% rate. However, achieving the aspirational 1.5°C goal remains unlikely, necessitating further ambition. Even with enhanced ambition, global temperatures may temporarily exceed 1.5°C this century, making near-term collective ambition vital to limit temperature overshooting and incentivize R&D in technologies like carbon dioxide removal, accelerate fossil fuel phase-out, and engage the private sector for cost-effective long-term GHG reductions.\nKey gaps persist in climate policy despite progress. Addressing non-CO2 emissions, carbon dioxide removal (CDR), and halting deforestation is crucial. Reducing non-CO2 emissions by 2030 can help curb temperature rise and overshooting the 1.5°C threshold, impacting global temperature change. CDR, essential for achieving net-zero emissions, lacks detailed plans in many countries’ commitments. There’s a gap between proposed CDR levels and what’s needed for Paris goals, and current technologies are not ready or cost-effective. Incentivizing research and development in novel CDR methods is vital. Halting deforestation is paramount, as it contributes significantly to emissions, but despite commitments, deforestation continues, driven by commercial crop expansion. Closing these policy gaps is essential for effective climate action.\nAchieving deeper near-term reductions in non-CO2 emissions is feasible through various technological solutions, including end-of-pipe control measures and behavioral changes like dietary shifts. Some post-COP26 efforts, such as the United States Inflation Reduction Act and China’s policies addressing methane emissions, demonstrate increased ambition in this regard. However, global ambition in non-CO2 emission reductions should encompass a broader range of gases, account for emissions from all sectors, and prioritize R&D for long-term solutions. Additionally, scaling up carbon dioxide removal (CDR) measures is essential, requiring increased investment in a diverse portfolio of CDR technologies beyond current efforts. Effective emissions trading mechanisms for CDR necessitate robust accounting rules and monitoring frameworks, as well as consideration of synergies and tradeoffs with other sustainability priorities.\nImplications for Korea: Korea has set an ambitious goal to achieve carbon neutrality, but to contribute meaningfully to global collective action and achieve the 1.5°C goal, there is a need for strengthening near-term NDCs. Faster coal-fired powerplant retirement and rapid increase in clean power generation will be critical near-term steps.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2023.08.019"

    "title": "State-by-state energy-water-land-health impacts of the US net-zero emissions goal",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In a new paper published in Energy and Climate Change journal, international team of researchers from X, Y, and Z used an integrated assessment model to investigate four approaches to achieving the U.S. net-zero emission goal and analyzed their impacts on energy, water, land, and public health within each state. “This research serves as a foundation for gaining a deeper understanding of the effects of the U.S. net-zero emission goal and aims to lead this goal towards cost-effective and environmentally sustainable change,” said Haewon McJeon, visiting professor at KAIST Graduate School of Green Growth & Sustainability. \n\nThis study utilizes GCAM v6.0 USA version, focusing on modeling various elements of the U.S., including its economy, energy system, agriculture, land use, water, and more, at the state level. The model incorporates consistent assumptions regarding population and economic growth and includes estimates for past and future greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutant levels. The research presents four distinct pathways to achieve net-zero emissions in the U.S. These pathways include the existing net-zero pathway, along with three additional alternative net-zero pathways designed to account for uncertainties in low-carbon technologies, carbon removal methods, and carbon reduction. GCAM-USA takes into account price adjustment for non-CO2 greenhouse gases, as well as considers the impact of technology lifespan tracking and mortality rates related to particulate matter exposure. \nThe findings of this study suggest that the net-zero emissions pathway requires a significant reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. The electricity and transportation sectors play a pivotal role, and achieving this goal necessitates a combination of fundamental GHG emissions reductions and the implementation of carbon dioxide removal technologies (CDR). The successful execution of carbon removal technologies depends on technology, economic viability, public approval, and regulatory support. Regionally within the United States, several states play a critical role in GHG emissions reduction, with states such as Texas, California, and Florida being among the significant contributors. These states account for a substantial portion of the national GHG reduction, with much of the emphasis on GHG reductions primarily within the electricity sector.\nCarbon removal technologies are distributed differently among states, with Texas, for instance, having a larger carbon capture capacity due to factors like its geological terrain. Nevertheless, substantial investments and policy support are required to achieve large-scale carbon capture. Clean energy investments also hold a vital role in accomplishing carbon reductions, with expanding renewable energy capacity and reducing fossil fuel capacity being crucial focal points. Additionally, the U.S. net-zero pathway offers environmental benefits, including positive impacts on demand reduction, air quality, and land use. Sustainability outcomes in the net-zero pathway can vary depending on the specific trajectory, with diverse co-benefits and trade-offs observed on a state-by-state basis. \nThis study provides a comprehensive analysis to evaluate the US net-zero emission goals and to understand state-level actions and interactions. It considers various net-zero pathways while accounting for uncertainties such as low-carbon technologies, carbon management strategies, policies, behavioral changes, and more. The research results illustrate that these different pathways may have varying economic and sustainability impacts in each state, emphasizing the importance of considering this diversity of impacts. It also highlights that not accounting for these various effects can be problematic. Furthermore, in addition to the climate mitigation benefits, the study identifies environmental benefits, such as water conservation and air quality improvements.\nHowever, it acknowledges that in some states, there may be discrepancies between mitigation costs and benefits, which can vary depending on the burden-sharing approach. The study also explores burden-sharing approaches, demonstrating varying outcomes on a state-by-state basis and underscoring the importance of state and federal cooperation for the United States to achieve its net-zero goals. The research also highlights the need for capital investments in the net-zero transition and underscores the critical role of policies and regulations.  \nKorea also has a 2050 carbon neutrality goal. The lessons learned from this research can also be expanded to better understanding the economically sustainable transition towards achieving net-zero emissions in Korea. An in-depth research is needed for the comprehensive assessment of Korea’s net-zero transitions. \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2023.08.019\n한국어 요약  \n미국의 탄소중립 배출량 목표가 주별 에너지, 수자원, 토지, 건강에 미치는 영향 평가  \n2021년 유엔 기후 회의에서 미국은 온실 가스 배출을 2005년 대비 50-52% 감축하고, 2050년까지 탄소중립을 달성하기로 기후 공약을 발표했다. 더불어 미국은 2035년까지 100% 탄소 오염이 없는 전기를 사용하는 것을 목표로 하고 있다. 이런 미국의 기후 목표가 탄소 배출 감축과 토지 이용, 자본 움직임 및 재정, 고용, 대기오염 관련 건강에 복합적으로 영향을 미쳐 경제적 및 지속 가능한 변화에 영향을 미칠 것으로 예상된다.  \n카이스트 녹색성장지속가능대학원 전해원 방문교수를 포함한 한국과 중국 등의 국제 연구진은 통합평가모델을 사용하여 미국의 탄소중립 달성을 위한 네 가지 접근 방식을 탐구하고 해당 주에서의 에너지, 물, 토지, 공중보건에 미치는 영향을 분석한 논문을 Energy and Climate Change 저널에 출간하였다.  \n통합평가모델을 활용한 이번 연구는 미국의 탄소중립목표의 영향을 보다 심층적으로 이해하기 위한 기초를 마련하며, 해당 목표로의 비용 효율적이고 환경적으로 지속 가능한 전환을 촉진하려는 목적을 가지고 있다는 점에서 큰 의미가 있다. 이 연구는 한국의 ’2050년 탄소중립’이라는 기후 목표가 미치는 영향에 대한 심도 있는 분석의 필요성을 시사한다."

    "section": "",
    "text": "An international team of authors from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, University of Maryland, ExxonMobil Technology and Engineering Company, and Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) researched the potential of hydrogen as a low-carbon energy carrier. The paper evaluated hydrogen’s deployment using the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM). It comprehensively analyzes the supply and demand drivers of global hydrogen deployment in the transition towards a decarbonized energy system.\n“The actual amount of hydrogen use may be small compared to the total energy use, but hydrogen provides important decarbonization options in several keys”hard-to-abate sectors,” said the corresponding author, Haewon McJeon, a visiting professor at KAIST Graduate School of Green Growth and Sustainability.\nHydrogen’s role in reducing global energy emissions is gaining policymaker’s attention, especially in the industrial and transportation sectors. Although integrated assessment models (IAMs) have delved into hydrogen’s potential, few have assessed the impact of hydrogen delivery infrastructure—a critical factor given the expected substantial costs of hydrogen transmission and distribution (T&D). This study broadens the scope of prior research, highlighting the significance of hydrogen T&D in determining hydrogen supply chain decisions.\nIn core scenarios, global hydrogen production remains under 2.5 EJ until 2030 and reaches 10 EJ to 22 EJ across scenarios by 2050, accounting for about 9 to 20% of 2015’s total transportation energy consumption. Green hydrogen will become the predominant source by 2050, with 36 to 69% of total production. Most green hydrogen is produced onsite due to cost advantages, even when considering economies of scale for central production. By 2050, onsite hydrogen production will comprise over half of the total, with blue hydrogen making up 24 to 29%. Introducing dedicated hydrogen T&D allows for diverse hydrogen sources, including natural gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS) and bioenergy with CCS (BECCS). The study’s findings align with the IPCC AR6 database scenarios for 2°C warming limits.\nBy 2050, under both Reference and High Demand scenarios, industrial hydrogen consumption is projected to be on par with or surpass transportation hydrogen demand, making up 40 to 76% of total hydrogen use, which translates to approximately 7 to 11 EJ (or up to 12.5 EJ when factoring in hydrogen blended with gas). Rapid cost reductions in hydrogen-based transportation can bring about a large increase in hydrogen use in this sector. In the High Demand scenarios, total hydrogen consumption outpaces the Reference Demand scenarios by 8 to 9 EJ (or 70 to 84%) in 2050. Despite these numbers, hydrogen only constitutes a minor fraction (2- 4%) of total final energy by mid-century but has the potential for significant deployment post-2050, especially under stricter climate objectives. In industry, hydrogen’s primary application is anticipated for high-temperature heat processes, with its role in sectors like cement expected to grow considerably in the latter half of the century.​\nHydrogen consumption patterns reveal significant roles for both truck and pipeline transport. However, pipelines are generally preferred over trucks when both options are feasible, primarily due to cost considerations. Despite these delivery methods, onsite hydrogen production remains dominant, consistently surpassing amounts delivered by either trucks or pipelines. Additionally, hydrogen consumption in the industrial sector is often on par with, if not exceeding, that in the transportation sector. This data is crucial when assessing potential hydrogen leakage, especially given the emerging concerns regarding hydrogen’s indirect climate impacts.\nThis study delved into hydrogen’s potential role in decarbonization, examining factors like hydrogen transmission & distribution (T&D) infrastructure, end-use technology costs, and climate policy stringency using GCAM. “While hydrogen T&D may impact the production mix, it does not appear to meaningfully impact the scale of supply.” said the lead author Patrick O’Rourke, a PhD candidate at the University of Maryland. “Especially when accounting for distributed production options, onsite production becomes a dominant method, primarily from green hydrogen.” The study found that on the demand side, hydrogen’s use in industries, especially for high-temperature heat, surpasses its transportation uses in most scenarios. However, end-use technology costs influence hydrogen’s role in the energy transition more than T&D infrastructure assumptions. In addition, the hydrogen deployment is sensitive to increased climate policy stringency. Future research should consider the potential leakage in the hydrogen supply chain and further explore hydrogen’s applications in the power sector and hydrogen-derived fuel production.​\nImplications for Korea: Major energy-importing countries like Korea face a dual challenge where they need to decarbonize the energy supply while expanding the international transmission and distribution system. Reducing the cost and leakage of hydrogen imports will be the key to the successful development of the hydrogen economy. \nRead the full paper here: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c03751\n한국어 요약\n수소경제 이송과 분배의 중요성 연구\n탄소중립을 달성하기 위해 핵심적인 기술 중의 하나인 수소에너지의 이송과 분배(T&D)의 중요성이 부각되고 있다.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is considered a pivotal federal climate legislation in the United States, holding potential to lower greenhouse gas emissions, reduce energy costs, and address inequalities within the energy system. However, the complexity and broad scope of the IRA raise uncertainties regarding its impact on the energy system and related emissions.\n“IRA is assessed to have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lower energy costs, and address inequalities in the energy system,” said KAIST visiting professor Haewon McJeon, who coauthored the study. “This study is the first multi-model analysis to demonstrate the potential effects of IRA on the power sector.”\nThis study indicates that the IRA tends to reduce coal and natural gas generation while increasing the share of low-emission power sources. The impact of IRA closures affects coal power plants more than natural gas ones, while low-emission sources like renewables, nuclear, and CCS-equipped generation expand. The research suggests that IRA drives faster and deeper emissions reductions in the power sector compared to other sectors. The findings show that carbon dioxide emissions in the power sector are reduced by 47-83% from 2005 levels by 2030, further decreasing by an additional 66-87% by 2035.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis sheds light on the potential impacts of the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) on the U.S. power sector, highlighting its role in driving emissions reductions and shaping the energy landscape. This study indicates that power generation holds the largest share in U.S. reductions, according to models, and they unanimously agree. Also, there’s a consensus that coal-fired generation needs to retire relatively quickly. However, there are varying predictions among models regarding the proportions of solar, wind, and nuclear, indicating the need for further research. It underscores various uncertainties such as deployment challenges, policy effectiveness, technological changes, and model differences that can influence the impact of IRA.\nResearch conducted using a single model comes with considerable uncertainties, emphasizing the need for comparing multiple models in this study. In this regard, the ongoing role of K-EMF (Korea Energy Modeling Forum) holds great importance. The future research of K-EMF can also address similar policies in Korea. Moreover, such studies can provide valuable insights for developing policies tailored to the situation in Korea.  \nRead the full paper here: https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad0d3b\n한국어 요약\n인플레이션 감축법안 (IRA) 이 2022년에 발효된 이후 전력 부문에 미치는 영향\n2022년 발효된 인플레이션 감축법안 (IRA) 은 미국에서 가장 중요한 연방 기후법안으로 간주되며 온실가스 배출을 감소시키고 에너지 비용을 낮추며 에너지 시스템의 불평등을 해결할 잠재력이 있다고 평가된다. 그러나 IRA의 복잡성과 폭넓은 범위로 인해 에너지 시스템 및 관련 배출에 미치는 영향이 불확실하다.\n카이스트 녹색성장지속가능대학원 전해원 방문교수를 포함한 연구진은 이런 불확실성을 고려하여 IRA가 전력 부문에 미치는 잠재적인 영향에 대한 최초의 다중 모델 분석을 Environmental Research Letters 저널에 출간하였다.\n이 연구는 단일 모델이 가지는 큰 불확실성을 줄이기 위해 여러 모델의 비교가 중요하다는 것을 시사한다. 그런 의미에서 한국에서 현재 진행중인 한국 에너지모델링포럼 (K-EMF) 의 역할에 시사하는 점이 크다.\n논문 링크: https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad0d3b"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This research improves upon the integrated assessment model, GCAM, by including processes such as steam cracking, which is prevalent in the organic chemical industry. The study evaluates various carbon reduction strategies like catalytic cracking, low-carbon process heat, and feedstock switching.\nKey findings of the study indicate that while emerging catalytic production technologies might not substantially reduce mid-century emissions, generating process heat can lead to considerable mitigation, potentially cutting CO2 emissions by about 76% by 2050. This is achievable through methods like carbon capture and storage (CCS), hydrogen, and electrification. The research also points out that a significant amount of energy in this sector is used for producing chemicals like ammonia and methanol, necessitating detailed modeling to assess these carbon reduction pathways effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nA notable feature of this model is its detailed parameterization of both traditional and alternative organic chemical manufacturing processes, including waste management for end-of-life products like plastics. The study also examines interactions with other economic sectors and the global economy, underscoring the potential of electrification and clean hydrogen. Additionally, it highlights that future net CO2 emissions are highly sensitive to the global deployment of CCS. Achieving net-zero emissions seems unattainable if the rate of waste incineration increases without coupling it with CCS. Furthermore, reducing feedstock emissions depends significantly on using biogenic carbon as an alternative feedstock and effective waste treatment of plastics.\nThis research represents a substantial step forward in mitigating the impact of the organic chemical sector on climate change. It suggests a more integrated approach to explore various carbon mitigation strategies and calls for further research in different industries for more significant carbon reduction in the future.\n“Petrochemicals industry is inherently fossil fuel driven,” said KAIST Visiting Professor Haewon McJeon, who coauthored the paper. “Decarbonizing chemical production emissions will be difficult but crucial contribution to achieving net-zero emissions.”\nRead the full paper here : https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c05202\n한국어 요약\n유기 화학 및 플라스틱 산업에서 CO2 배출을 완화하기 위한 주요 경로에 대한 통합 평가\n우리 대학 녹색성장지속가능대학원 전해원 방문교수를 포함한 국제 연구진은 최근 Environmental Science and Technology 저널에 게제한 논문에서 화학 산업에서의 CO2 배출을 감소시키기 위한 새로운 접근을 제시하였다. 이 연구는기존GCAM 모델에 화학산업 배출량 감축을 위한 기술을 포함하여 확장하였다. 연구 결과에 따르면, 신기술을 활용하여2050년까지 CO2 배출을 약 76%까지 줄일 수 있는 가능성이 있다고 한다. 이 연구는 유기 화학 산업의 기후 변화에 미치는 영향을 이해하고 줄이는 데 있어 중요한 진전을 이루었으며, 향후 다양한 산업 분야에서의 실질적인 탄소 감축과 이행을 위한 추가 연구의 필요성을 시사한다.\n논문 링크 : https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c05202"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Brazil, along with all major nations around the world, committed to net-zero. The paper discusses the need for global emissions reduction outlined by the IPCC and the challenges associated with achieving these goals. It emphasizes the importance of Brazil’s biofuel production potential and explores scenarios involving electrification and biofuels in the transportation sector. The study compares various pathways using the BLUES Integrated Assessment Model, considering both international and national trends.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis study explains that various strategies are compatible with Brazil’s mid-century net-zero carbon goal but differ in cost and the country’s competitive advantages. Most technological components of the IEA’s net-zero trajectory assume almost complete compatibility with Brazil’s electrification strategy, contingent on significant research and development investments. The recent budget cuts in Brazil’s public research and development resources make the realization of this scenario challenging, as outlined in the research.\nMoreover, the study anticipates that negative emissions will play a crucial role in Brazil achieving net-zero carbon by 2050 in all scenarios, especially impacting changes in the energy sector. Afforestation and pasture recovery are highlighted as important CDR options for Brazil. Comparing the four scenarios, a biofuels-based strategy is expected to provide more room for negative emissions from bioenergy integrated with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). This implies that a phase-out of internal combustion engines (ICEs) could have an impact, leading to an increased dependence on the use of biofuels. However, biofuels remain relevant in all scenarios, even when used in hard-to-abate sectors through cellulosic fuels.\nIn conclusion, the importance of negative emissions, the impact of different strategies on achieving net-zero, and the continued relevance of biofuels in Brazil’s decarbonization efforts are emphasized in the study. The paper concludes with insights for shaping mid-century strategies in Brazil, highlighting the significance of stakeholder engagement and the need for realistic milestones in achieving net-zero targets. The challenges posed by budget constraints on research and development underscore the need for careful consideration of the country’s unique circumstances in pursuing sustainable and cost-effective pathways.\n“Each and every country needs to develop their own science-based pathways to achieve carbon-neutrality,” said KAIST visiting professor Haewon McJeon, who coauthored the study. “But there’s no one-size-fits-all carbon neutrality policy, each pathway needs to be based on region-specific circumstances.

It utilizes a variety of energy-economy models under harmonized scenarios to analyze the distributional dimensions of technology transitions and net-zero policies, mainly focusing on their impact on household welfare across different income levels. The analysis combines outputs from detailed energy system models with survey data on energy expenditures, offering a detailed look at the distributional effects of net-zero policies.\nThe study finds that direct energy expenditures for households will likely decrease over time with reference and net-zero policies. However, there are variations in the extent of these changes. The models used in the study generally agree that lower-income households face relatively higher energy burdens than higher-income households. A key aspect of the study is the emphasis on policy design, particularly using revenues generated from climate policies. Recycling these revenues can mitigate higher energy burdens, potentially leading to progressive outcomes where lower-income groups benefit more proportionally.\nAnother important finding is that employing an expenditure-based analysis rather than an income-based one provides a more accurate estimation of the distributional impacts, offering a clearer picture of the progressivity of emissions policies. The study also introduces the concept of carbon Laffer curves in the context of net-zero policies, where the revenues from these policies initially increase but then decrease as policy stringencies heighten. This dynamic can influence the progressive nature of climate policies.\nThe research underscores the importance of policy design in shaping the distributional outcomes of net-zero emissions policies and suggests areas for future research. This includes exploring alternative policy designs, assessing the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act, and examining the horizontal equity dimensions of net-zero policies. Overall, the study provides a comprehensive analysis of how net-zero emissions policies can affect different income groups and highlights the critical role of policy design in ensuring equitable outcomes.\nRead the full paper here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egycc.2023.100118\n한국어 요약\n탄소중립의 영향 공정성: 탈탄소화 정책에 따른 소득 계층별 에너지 지출에 대한 다중모델분석\n21세기 중반기까지 탄소 중립 목표를 추구하는 기업, 국가, 지역들이 증가함에 따라, 이러한 목표가 가구들의 복지에 어떠한 영향을 미치는지에 대한 질문이 제기되고 있다. \n우리 대학 녹색성장지속가능대학원 전해원 방문교수를 포함한 국제 연구진은 소득계층 간의 직접적인 에너지 지출 변화에 초점을 맞춘 탄소 중립 정책의 분배적 영향에 관한 최초의 다중 모델 연구를 Energy and Climate change 저널에 출간하였다. \n다중모델을 활용한 이번 연구는 탄소 중립을 향한 전환 과정에서 경제적, 사회적 형평성을 달성하기 위한 중요한 지침을 제공하는 것에 큰 의미가 있다. \n논문 링크: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egycc.2023.100118"

    "text": "The IPCC’s AR6 emphasizes the importance of land-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) measures, such as reforestation and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), to meet the Paris Agreement goals. The suggested carbon budgets for limiting global warming to well below 2°C and 1.5°C are 1150 and 500 GtCO2, respectively. The AR6 scenario database indicates a cumulative land-based CDR of 460 (350–560) GtCO2 between 2020 and 2100, with BECCS and reforestation playing significant roles. Challenges include potential trade-offs between BECCS and land-use change, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) removals, suggesting leakage issues. Land-intensive BECCS and reforestation face challenges related to advanced technologies and expanding forests, respectively.\n\n\n\nImpact of land carbon pricing strength on key outcomes under 2 °C scenarios.\n\n\nVariability among models in considering land-system mitigation policies makes it challenging to understand drivers and trade-offs fully. A new study published in Nature Communications used the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) to highlight the policy effects on land-based CDR, trade-offs, and global market-mediated responses. Different scenarios with varied carbon pricing and mitigation policies provide insights into policy effectiveness and implications for agricultural commodity prices. However, uncertainties related to sustainability, resource use, and institutional challenges in large-scale land-based CDR deployment require careful consideration by decision-makers.\nThe exploration centers on the uncertainty in predicting land-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and its economic and environmental impacts. Analyzing various scenarios with land-based mitigation policies, a range of 100 to 700 GtCO2 for cumulative land-based CDR by the end of the century is revealed.\nThe deployment of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is influenced by land-system mitigation policies, and valuing soil carbon storage reduces emissions leakage, lowering mitigation costs. The examination emphasizes the inverse relationship between cumulative BECCS and land-use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) removals, highlighting the contribution of BECCS and reforestation to 1.5°C and 2°C scenarios.\nInsights include the higher removal intensity of BECCS over time, sensitivity of BECCS to feedstock and technology choices, and the importance of soil management and policy choices for reforestation. Tradeoffs between removal effectiveness and agricultural price responses are emphasized, underscoring the need for careful design of land-based mitigation policies considering food security and sustainability.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) imports have recently gotten renewed interest in Korea, Japan, and Europe. To bring low-carbon alternatives to LNG for these countries, evaluating the possibility of using Liquified Hydrogen (LH2) or Liquified Ammonia (LNH3), coupled with carbon capture and storage (CCS), was needed.\nIn a new paper published in Environmental Research Letters, an international team of researchers conducted an in-depth analysis of the potential environmental impact of substituting LNG with LH2 or LNH3, particularly in the context of low-carbon futures.\nThe core findings highlight that the potential of LH2-CCS and LNH3-CCS to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is highly uncertain. Estimates suggest that these fuels could reduce GHG emissions by 25-61% compared to LNG, assuming a 100-year global warming potential. However, coupling LNG directly with CCS could lead to substantial GHG reductions of about 74%. Notably, under certain unfavorable conditions, emissions from LH2-CCS and LNH3-CCS might exceed those from LNG by up to 44%, raising questions about the suitability for stringent decarbonization.\nA comprehensive framework is provided by analyzing thermodynamic conversion efficiencies, fugitive emissions, and secondary climate impacts, which is crucial for comparing the efficacy of different energy pathways in addressing climate change. This approach reveals that the overall environmental profile of LH2-CCS and LNH3-CCS is complex and requires thorough scrutiny, especially given the significant variation in results and high uncertainties in input data.\nThe study also delves into the complexities of the alternatives’ supply chains, considering factors like energy conversion efficiency, fugitive emissions, and the direct and indirect global warming potentials along the supply chain. It underscores the need for thorough quantification and consideration of each pathway’s direct and indirect GHG emissions before investing in hydrogen and ammonia technologies.\n“Korea and Japan,” said Haewon McJeon, Visiting Professor at KAIST Graduate School of Green Growth and Sustainability, “are ambitious about using imported hydrogen and ammonia to achieve carbon neutrality. However, our research shows this approach could backfire if the hydrogen and ammonia come from fossil fuel energy sources or use ineffective transportation methods, making them unsuitable for carbon neutrality. More research focus is needed to incorporate clean energy-based hydrogen in the decarbonization efforts.”\nRead the full paper here: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ad376f/meta\n한국어 요약\n액화천연가스(LNG)를 액화수소(LH2)나 암모니아(LNH3)로 대체하여 기후에 도움이 될 수 있을까?\n액화 천연 가스(LNG) 수입에 최근 한국, 일본, 유럽에서 관심이 다시 높아지고 있다. 이러한 국가들에 LNG에 대한 저탄소 대안을 제공하기 위해, 탄소 포집 및 저장(CCS)과 결합된 액화 수소(LH2) 또는 액화 암모니아(LNH3) 사용 가능성을 평가해야 했다.\n’Environmental Research Letters’에 발표된 새로운 논문에서, 국제 연구진은 특히 저탄소 미래의 맥락에서 LNG를 LH2 또는 LNH3로 대체할 경우의 잠재적인 환경 영향에 대한 심층 분석을 수행했다.\n연구의 핵심 결과는 LH2-CCS 및 LNH3-CCS가 온실가스(GHG) 배출을 줄일 수 있는 가능성이 매우 불확실하다는 점을 강조한다. 추정에 따르면, 이 연료들은 100년의 지구 온난화 가능성을 가정할 때, LNG에 비해 온실가스 배출량을 25-61% 감소시킬 수 있다. 그러나 LNG를 직접 CCS와 결합하면 오히려 약 74% 만큼의 상당한 온실가스 감축을 이끌어낼 수 있다고 보여진다. 특히, 특정 불리한 조건에서 LH2-CCS 및 LNH3-CCS의 배출량은 LNG의 배출량을 최대 44%까지 초과할 수 있어, 엄격한 탄소 감축을 위한 적합성에 대한 의문이 제기된다.\n이 연구는 열역학적 변환 효율성, 비산 누출 및 2차 기후 영향을 분석하여 포괄적인 프레임워크를 제공하며, 이는 기후 변화를 해결하는 데 있어 다양한 에너지 경로의 효율성을 비교하는데 중요하다. 이 접근법은 LH2-CCS와 LNH3-CCS의 전반적인 환경 프로필이 복잡하고 철저한 조사가 필요하다는 것을 보여준다. 특히 결과의 상단한 변동성과 입력 데이터의 높은 불확실성을 고려하면 더욱 그렇다.\n이 연구는 또한 에너지 변환 효율성, 비산 누출, 공급망에 따른 직간접적인 지구 온난화 잠재력과 같은 요소를 고려하여 대안 공급망의 복잡성을 조사한다. 이는 수소 및 암모니아 기술에 투자하기 전에 각 경로의 직접 및 간접적인 온실가스 배출량을 철저히 정량화하고 고려할 필요성을 강조한다.\nKAIST 녹색성장지속가능대학원의 전해원 방문교수는 “한국과 일본은 탄소 중립을 달성하기 위해 수입 수소와 암모니아를 사용하는 것에 대해 야심 찬 계획을 가지고 있다. 그러나 이번 연구에 따르면 화석 연료 에너지원에서 생산되거나 비효율적인 운송 방법을 사용한 수소와 암모니아는 탄소 중립에 부적합하다는 것을 보여준다. 탄소중립을 위해서는 청정 에너지 기반 수소의 역활이 중요하다”고 말했다.\n논문 링크: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ad376f/meta"

    "section": "",
    "text": "“Modeling direct air carbon capture and storage in a 1.5°C climate future using historical analogues” recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , examines the integral role of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies in achieving the 1.5°C global temperature target. The paper addresses the pressing need for advanced modeling techniques to accurately predict the adoption of these technologies, particularly direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), which are essential for mitigating climate change. This paper proposes a novel approach that utilizes empirical data from historical technology adoption and integrates these insights with advanced modeling to forecast different growth scenarios for DACCS.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe paper begins by situating the significance of DACCS within the broader framework of international climate goals, emphasizing its necessity in scenarios aiming to limit global warming to 1.5°C. It then delves into the modeling methodology, employing the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) enhanced by historical technology analogues to simulate potential growth pathways for DACCS. The analysis reveals a wide range of outcomes, with DACCS’ potential contribution varying significantly depending on the analogues chosen, illustrating how different growth rates can impact the overall effectiveness of climate policies.\nFurther, the paper discusses the implications of these findings for energy sector investments, stranded assets, and the phasing out of unabated fossil fuels. It highlights how varying growth scenarios for DACCS influence the dynamics of residual emissions and the urgency of transitioning to renewable energy sources. The paper concludes by calling for interdisciplinary collaboration to refine these models and develop tailored policies that enhance the scalability of DACCS, thereby ensuring robust strategies to meet stringent emission targets.\nThe paper underscores the interdisciplinary nature of climate and energy research, suggesting that comprehensive modeling efforts are essential to understand the complex interactions between technology adoption, policy development, and environmental outcomes. It advocates for continuous refinement of models based on empirical data and stresses the importance of policy frameworks that can adapt to new insights into technology growth and adoption.\n“Net-zero pledges are counting on CO2 removal technologies to deliver at gigaton scale,” said KAIST visiting professor Haewon McJeon, who coauthored the study. “However, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding how much CO2 removal is possible. This study sheds light on how to think about CO2 removal technology using historical analogues of technology scale-up.”\nRead the full paper here: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2215679121\n한국어 요약\n1.5°C 기후 목표에 대응하는 직접 공기 이산화탄소 포집 및 저장 기술의 모델링\n파리 협정과 관련하여 지구 온난화를 산업화 이후1.5°C이내로 줄이기 위한 노력이 이어지고 있다. 카이스트 녹색성장 지속가능대학원 전해원 방문 교수를 포함한 국제 연구진은 이러한 1.5°C 기후 목표에 대응하기 위한 하나의 방편으로서 직접 공기 이산화탄소 포집 및 저장 기술과 관련한 모델링 연구를 “Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)”에 발간하였다. \n이 연구는 1.5°C 지구 온도 목표 달성을 위해 필수적인 이산화탄소 제거(CDR) 기술, 특히 직접 대기 중 탄소 포집 및 저장(DACCS)의 중요성을 다루며, 해당 기술 도입 예측을 위하여 모델링이 제시하는 기술적 가능성과 그 필요성에 대해 전하고 있다. 연구진은 역사적으로 채택된 기술 데이터를 토대로 다양한 DACCS의 시나리오를 제시하며, 이를 통해 향후 기후 정책 효과에 미치는 영향을 분석한다. 이 분석은 선택한 기술 경로(아날로그)에 따라 DACCS의 잠재적 기여도가 크게 달라지는 결과를 보여주며, 그에 따른 해당 기술의 성장 정도가 기후 정책의 전반적인 효과에 대해 분석한 것에 의의가 있다.\n논문 링크: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2215679121"

    "title": "Ambitious efforts on residual emissions can reduce CO2 removal and lower peak temperatures in a Net-Zero future",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The achievement of the Paris Agreement’s goals of below 2°C or 1.5°C is challenging without large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Nations often allocate significant amounts of residual emissions to be offset using CDR in their long-term strategies to achieve net-zero emissions. This includes emissions that are costly or beyond the direct control of companies or industries. While acknowledging the importance of CDR, growing attention has been directed towards concerns about the sustainability, feasibility, and political economy of CDR, limiting the perceived necessity of CDR as these concerns are investigated in the literature. However, as of my last knowledge update there is no existing IAM study that evaluates how comprehensive adoption of behavioral changes and emerging technologies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions could contribute to reducing the role of CDR portfolios. Therefore, this study assesses, using GCAM, the extent to which maximum efforts to reduce gross emissions in power, fuel supply, transportation, buildings, industry, and agriculture can minimize the demand for CDR.\n\nIn a new paper published in Environmental Research Letters, a sectoral strengthening approach was applied, incorporating demand reduction through behavioral changes, increased energy and material efficiency, rapid electrification of transportation, reduction of non-CO2 greenhouse gases, and limitations on bioenergy and geologic carbon storage. The “Maximum Sectoral Effort” scenario was formulated to minimize residual emissions while quantifying the lower limit of CDR needed to meet the requirements of the Paris Agreement. This study imposed a constraint on greenhouse gas emissions using GCAM 6.0 to limit global warming to below 1.5˚C until 2100. In the “Maximum Sectoral Effort” scenario, efforts focused on increasing the adoption of low-carbon technologies to further reduce CDR.\nAccording to the research findings, to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions within the global carbon limit, greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity, buildings, industry, energy supply, and transportation sectors must be significantly reduced compared to 2015 levels. Maximum sectoral effort drives additional greenhouse gas reductions and increases removals related to land use, land-use change, and forestry, thereby reducing CDR and leading to net greenhouse gas reduction. By 2050, significant emissions reductions are observed across most sectors to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions. CO2 emissions from electricity production using fossil fuels are nearly eliminated. The expanded use of electric vehicles and zero-carbon fuels can significantly reduce CO2 emissions across various sectors. Phasing out fossil fuels gradually leads to substantial reductions in CH4 emissions as well.\nReductions in non-CO2 emissions and increased carbon storage in soils have a significant impact on climate temperature changes. In the long term, shifts towards plant-based diets and decreased fossil fuel extraction lead to reduced methane emissions, resulting in decreased climate forcing. Additionally, enhanced CO2 mitigation from land use strengthens the CO2 emission constraints, further reducing climate forcing. These changes collectively result in low temperature rises, while overshooting the 1.5°C warming target but maintaining it at a lower level under Maximum Sectoral Effort, significantly reducing end-of-century warming. All scenarios are aligned with 1.5˚C scenarios, but comparing total emissions and CDR reveals significant differences between our scenario and AR6. Maximum Sectoral Effort leads to a reduction in gross greenhouse gas emissions and minimize reliance on CDR. Almost complete elimination of CO2 emissions from electricity and buildings by mid-century aligns with the highest ambition level in AR6 scenarios.\nIAM models often simulate technological development through carbon pricing. However, initial CDR technologies may incur higher costs than predicted by the models, especially when considering behavioral or demand-side policies or when it’s difficult to account for ancillary benefits. To address these issues, the authors have developed scenarios with ambitious levels of technology and behavioral aspirations across all sectors. These efforts demonstrate the potential to achieve net-zero CO2 and halve CDR requirements. Additionally, policies that reduce reliance on unsustainable diet and biofuels while utilizing soil-based carbon storage can expedite the reduction of gross CO2 emissions.\n“Let’s face it: decades of delayed climate action cornered us into an uncomfortable place where we can’t bring the global temperature back down to 1.5 degrees without massive CO2 removal,” said Prof. Haewon McJeon of KAIST Graduate School of Green Growth and Sustainability, who coauthored the study. “At this point we need both: early emission reduction efforts in all sectors of the economy, as well as R&D investments in CO2 removal technologies in order to scale up the drawdown efforts. Only when both efforts are successful can we achieve a long-term temperature change below 1.5 degrees.”\nRead the full paper here: https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad456d\n한국어 요약\n잔류 배출에 대한 야심찬 노력은 이산화탄소 제거를 줄이고 넷제로에서 미래의 최고 온도를 낮출 수 있다.\n파리 협약의 목표인 2°C 또는 1.5°C 이하 상승을 달성하기 위해서는 대규모 이산화탄소 제거(CDR)가 필수적이므로 많은 국가가 장기적인 넷제로 달성 전략에 CDR을 이용하여 상쇄하는 상당한 수준의 잔여 배출을 허용한다. 그러나 CDR의 지속 가능성, 실현 가능성, 정치 경제에 대한 우려가 커지고 있는 가운데 카이스트 녹색성장지속가능대학원 전해원 방문교수를 포함한 연구진은 통합 평가 모델을 사용하여, 부문별 온실가스 배출을 줄이고 CDR에 대한 필요성을 줄이는 “최대 부문별 노력” 시나리오 연구를 Environmental Research Letters 저널에 출간하였다.\n이 연구는 모든 부문에서 강력한 기술과 행동 정책을 통한 감축 노력으로 넷제로를 달성함과 동시에 CDR에 대한 의존도를 줄일 수 있음을 시사한다. 이산화탄소 배출 감축과 토지 사용 변화를 통해 온도를 1.5°C 이하로 유지하는 것의 중요성을 보여주며 지속가능성이 약한 CDR에 집중하는 것보다 탄소 배출을 줄이는 것이 기후 변화의 물리적 위험과 에너지시스템의 전환과정에서 위험을 줄일 수 있어 더 나은 전략임을 제시한다. 하지만 여전히 저탄소 기술과 행동변화에 대한 불확실성을 고려할 때, CDR의 역할을 무시할 수는 없다. KAIST의 전해원 방문교수는 “대규모 이산화탄소 제거 없이는 글로벌 온도를 1.5도로 낮추는 것이 불가능하며, 이 시점에서 우리에게 필요한 것은 경제 전 부문에서의 조기 배출 감축 노력 뿐만 아니라 이산화탄소 제거 기술에 대한 연구 및 개발 활동의 노력을 확대하는 것이다.”라고 시사한다.\n논문 링크: https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad456d"
